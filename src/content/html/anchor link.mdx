title: 'link to header'

aka anchor link

```
<a href={`#${heading.slug}`}>
    {heading.text}
</a>
```

## anchor links make article element move

anchor links can conflict with `overflow: hidden` on the article and cause this behavior apparently.
if you have overflow-x and overflow-y try removing it and using `word-break: break-word;`
on article content instead if possible
