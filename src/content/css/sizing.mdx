title: 'sizing (ADD MORE)'
---

*Absolute length units* - (generally considered) always the same size

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| `cm`, `mm`, `in` ... | **CAUTION:** mostly used for print, not screen display |
| `px` | pixels the GOAT |

*Relative length units* - are based on font, container, or viewport sizes

|     |     |
| --- | --- | 
| `em` | its parent's font size (used in `font-size`); otherwise its own font size |
| `rem` | its root's font size |
| `vh` | viewport's height. 1vh = 1% of vp height |
| `vw` | viewport's width. 1vw = 1% of vp width |
|     | ...and more! |

*Intristic size* - html elements have a natural size set before they're altered by css

*Extrinsic size* - size that's actively added

## em and rem

**Most popular** rel length units that are **super important** to understand!!!!

nested \<li> `1.3em` -> get progressively larger from \<html> to parent to parent

nested \<li> `1.3rem` -> get equally larger once from \<html>

**(TODO: WHICH ONES TO USE WHEN)**

## Percentage

% resolve against containing block's size.

**CAUTION:** When using a percentage you need to be aware what it is a percentage of.
Furthermore, % margin and padding is calculated from **inline size**, even when applied to height.

## How to avoid container overflow when dealing with variable content?

Try `min-` and `max-` sizes

## How to display responsive and crisp variable images in one container?

`max-width: 100%` images larger than container will be scaled down,
images smaller than container won't be stretched out

**CAUTION:** Don't use this technique to load huge images by default!
Always use appropriately sized images!

## Display full-page element with scrollable content below?

Such as an enormous news article header or product site's front page promo image that will amaze and confuse the viewer

Try `100vh`, pushing the rest of the content below viewport
