## How to add a web font?

1. Find web fonts
2. Generate the code using Webfont Generator or fontsqirrel.
You receive: woff and woff2, demo html, stylesheet.css with generated `@font-face` code
3. Put `@font-face` at the top of your css
4. Make sure in `@font-face` url() paths to font files are correct
5. Now you can use these fonts in font stacks!

## Using an online font service

Online font services store and serve fonts for you 
so you don't have to worry about writing the `@font-face` code

2. Get embed coode
3. Paste it into html in head above the css link element

## @font-face

font-family specifies the name YOU WANT TO REFER TO THE FONT AS

All\* browsers support WOFF/WOFF2

> The order in which you list font files is important.
> the browser will choose the first font file it's able to use. 
> That's why the format you list first should be the preferred format —
> that is, WOFF2 — with the older formats listed after that. 

## Best practices

Instead of declaring separate font family entries per italic/bold variation file,
declare them as one font with family with respective style/weight values
(see guide if confused)
