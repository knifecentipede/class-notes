## Properties

### What is font-family?

`font-family` -  font/list of fonts aka *font stack* to apply in order

**Recommended:** provide a suitable generic font name at the end of the font stack

### What are serif, sans-serif, monospace etc?

CSS defines five generic names for fonts: serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive, and fantasy. 
dispayed differently across browsers/devices. represents a *worst case scenario* where the browser will try its best to provide a font that looks appropriate

### What are font-style and font-weight?

`font-style`  - italic. values are italic, normal, oblique (fake italic that's just slanted normal)

`font-weight` - bold. many values available 

### font-size

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| `px` | pixels |
| `em` | its parent's font size |
| `rem` | its root's font size |

Instristic `font-size` of an element is inherited from that element's parent element. 
`<html>` has instristic `font-size: 16px`.

**CAUTION:** Avoid setting the `font-size` of container elements where possible

**(TODO: WHICH ONES TO USE WHEN)**

## How to space apart lines? Should I?

`line-height` property

Body text generally looks nicer and is easier to read when the lines are spaced apart!

**Recommended:** unitless value acts as a multiplier of `font-size`.
Usually 1.5 â€“ 2 (double spaced)
